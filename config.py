INITIAL_STORY_PROMPT = """
The series is about a boy called Mtuthuko, age 16, from the township of KwaThema, Springs, South Africa. 
He, his mother Thokozile (38), his sister Thandeka (22), and her baby Amahle (2) were kicked out of their family home by his mother's uncles, Henry and Ernest, while his mother was gravely ill.

They are forced to live in a two-bedroom shack infested with rats. This hardship fuels Mtuthuko's determination. He discovers his academic talent and focuses intensely on his education to change their circumstances.

He excels in his final school exams and gets into the University of Witwatersrand (Wits) to study Computer Science and Mathematics. However, his bursary only covers tuition. He faces homelessness, sleeping in university labs and toilets, and sometimes eating from dumpsters.

During this time, he builds strong friendships. Fifi, MJ, Raul, Fuzo, and Thapelo help him with food. Fuzo, Dope, Ayanda, and Thapelo offer him a place to sleep and wash.

Eventually, he secures a better bursary that includes accommodation. He graduates with honors in Data Science, publishing a scientific paper on hybrid recommendation systems with IEEE. He lands a job at a top bank, First National Bank (FNB), and is now a Senior Data Scientist, building advanced LLM and Multi-Agent Systems.

The series will start from the moment they are forced to move into the shack and will follow his journey, capturing the emotional highs and lows.
